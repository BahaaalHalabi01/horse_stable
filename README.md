# What do in need to do in this code base?

All the below shounld be in its own database file using the turso stuff

Some crud stuff
- Make it possible to create a horse stable
- Make it possible to add a horse to the stable
- Make it possible to remove a horse from the stable
- Make it possible to list all the horses in the stable

Optional shit generated by supermaven
- Make it possible to list all the horses in the stable that are not yet sold
- Make it possible to list all the horses in the stable that are sold
- Make it possible to list all the horses in the stable that are sold and not yet returned
- Make it possible to list all the horses in the stable that are returned
- Make it possible to list all the horses in the stable that are returned and not yet sold


For user authentication

I guess we need an admin user only and ablility to register workers

- admin user created by us, some script that creates the user
- worker user created by the admin in the dashboard


For our nice horses
- Clean the horse ( sets is being cleaned to true )
- Feed the horse ( sets is being fed to true )
- Train the horse ( sets is being trained to true )

the above should have a timer, and autmatically when the timer is up, the horse status is set to false
